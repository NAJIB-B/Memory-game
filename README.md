# Memory game 

This app is one of my biggest 
achievement in my early days of programming. I love this app.

It's a fun game that test the strength of your memory.
it has 16 tiles that flips for 2 seconds at the the begining of the game to reveal the cards, then you try to match each pair correctly. 

## Demo
